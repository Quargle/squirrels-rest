    <h1 >Mooli</h1>  
    <p>A mysterious vegetable.</p>
    <p>Inspect closely to reveal its secrets.</p>
    <p style="display:none">Mooli is a fourth-hand-tat-warehouse-cum-art-gallery. It has existed, perhaps, in an abandoned shipping container
    in Falmouth, Cornwall, although it's physical presence there has always been questionable.</p>
    <p style="display:none">Mooli is carefully curated and mismanaged by the wise philosopher known as Mr B. M. X. Ouse.</p>
    <p style="display: none;">For tax reasons, Mooli is now located within a small rodent sanctuary deep in the Cheshire countryside.</p>
